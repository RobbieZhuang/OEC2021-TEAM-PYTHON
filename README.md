Brainstorming

* Class that represents a period of time/transition

Classes & Modules
---
* People: Stores information for each person regarding their percentage of exposure
* ExposureChance: takes in a specific person and exposure
* Parsers: Reads information in from csv files



* Increase a classroom's exposure factor (multiplicative factor) everytime someone infected goes to a class and reset to 1.0 when the class is cleaned
* Maintain an exposure array with the previous and next exposures in order to factor in the 1 period incubation period and also make computing exposures simpler
